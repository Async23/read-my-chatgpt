## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Classify ChatGPT conversations as `chat`, `work`, or `unknown` from live Web
  response signals.
- Read completed Work conversation dialogue while omitting hidden agent events,
  internal reasoning, and tool execution.
- Expose conversation experience and completion status through MCP results.
- Extract structured links, web citations, Mermaid source, images, and ordinary
  file attachments from visible conversation messages.
- Add `get_asset` for size-limited, MIME-checked MCP image/resource delivery
  without exposing signed upstream download URLs.

### Fixed

- Wait for an existing launchd process to exit before bootstrapping a replacement
  during same-service upgrades.
- Treat decoded asset bytes as authoritative when HTTP content encoding makes the
  transfer length differ from the delivered file size.
