# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a vulnerability, access token, cookie,
private conversation, or other sensitive material.

Use GitHub's **Security → Report a vulnerability** flow for this repository.
Include only the minimum reproduction data and replace all real credentials
with test values.

We aim to acknowledge a complete report within seven days. Fix timing depends
on severity, reproducibility, and upstream behavior. Please allow time for a
coordinated fix before public disclosure.

## Supported versions

Only the latest published version receives security fixes.

## Local trust boundary

The HTTP MCP endpoint is intentionally limited to loopback and protected with a
generated Bearer token. Reports that require binding it to a LAN or public
interface are outside the supported security model.

Conversation assets are resolved only after their opaque id is found on the
active visible branch of the requested conversation. Downloads have a byte
limit and MIME checks. Cross-origin signed download URLs must use HTTPS and
never receive the ChatGPT access token; same-origin URLs may reuse it. Signed
URLs are not returned in MCP results or error messages.
